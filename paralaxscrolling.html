      <h2>Is a Smartwatch really worth it?</h2>
      <p>
        With today's gadget lovers, smartwatches are becoming more and more popular. Due to the large market, more companies are now producing smartwatches, including traditional watch companies such as Fossil. But one may wonder, what is so important and attractive about smartwatches?

Some may think that nowadays, with smartphones and digital advances, wristwatches are becoming somewhat less relevant. They often ask if it is necessary to have a separate device to tell you the time when your phone does that just fine? I cannot count the number of times I have heard people say that smartwatches are unnecessary. However, those who think like that simply do not understand what a smartwatch can do.

      <h2>Analog Wrist Watches</h2>
      
      <p>
        A good watch looks great with any outfit you wear. No matter the occasion, a watch acts as the perfect accessory that you need. The new-age definition of pocket watches may be smartphones, but a good old, unique analog watch can have a classic effect on the way people look at you. Besides analog watches, digital watches have been introduced by many brands. While digital watches have their own charm, here are a few reasons why we should preserve the beauty of an analog watch and wear them:

<strong> Easier Reach:</strong> When someone asks you for the time, sometimes you might find yourself fishing through your pocket or bag to find your phone. Cut all the hassles that come with such findings and stick to an analog watch. These watches rest on your wrist and its easy to depict the time with them, plus makes for a good first impression. 

<strong>2. Easy GPS:</strong> Smartphones do have a GPS setting but what happens when you run out of battery in the middle of nowhere? A watch can help! Analog watches can help you detect the direction. All you need is to know which hemisphere you are currently in and the position of the sun. Yes, guys! It is that easy! 

<strong>3. Classy Looks:</strong> Watches are a timeless piece. It can be used as an asset and is often passed down generations, after generations. Analog watches look classy on both men and women. Choose a watch that fits your wrist well, that will do the magic. Getting stainless steel bands is also a good option. Whatever the outfit, an analog watch can make it look great!

<strong>4. Portrays Responsibility:</strong> There is a perception that owning analog timepieces means you hold a certain position in society. Its still the same. Analog watches show that you can be responsible, an adult, on the path of embracing growing up. These watches, unlike the battery-powered ones, need constant care and have to be looked after so that they can work accurately. If you own one, it shows your sense of entitlement in many ways.</p>

      <h2>Digital Wrist Watches</h2>
      <p>
        Digital watches have many differences to their traditional analog counterparts. It may take a wearer of classic watches a long time to adapt to using and wearing a digital watch. However, the time display on a digital watch is incredibly easy to read both quickly and at a glance. The use of clear numbers rather than the standard hands and indices allows the watch to be much smaller and thinner. This makes many digital watches more lightweight and comfortable to wear. It is easy for watchmakers to design digital watches in a fun and vibrant array of colours as the display can be as small or as large as fits the specific model. With the advent of the smartwatch, digital watches have become somewhat redundant. However, digital watches have a retro charm and style, ensuring that they make a great companion for modern styling.
